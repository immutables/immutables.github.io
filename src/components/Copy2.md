**Adapt to your [coding style](/style.html)** and conventions. Naming templates allows for `get*`, `with*`, `Abstract*`, or `I*`
patterns to be used. Dozens of [styles](/allstyles.html) and feature toggles —  generate as much or as little
as you need. Use [custom immutable annotations](/style.html#custom-immutable-annotation). Use [encodings](/encoding.html) to integrate custom types
and containers.
