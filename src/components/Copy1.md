**Sweep boilerplate** under the rug like a pro.
Generate consistent and thread-safe [immutable](/immutable.html#value) implementations
for abstract classes and interfaces. [Builders](/immutable.html#builder) for [records](/newandnice.html#record-builder),
immutable classes, [factory methods](/factory.html#factory), and plain [constructors](/factory.html#pojo-constructors).
[Generated code](/generated.html) looks nice, a lot better than typical generators.
